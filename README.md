The objective of this work is to propose an adaptation in the methodology of technical planning of electric energy distribution systems, in order to consider the use of stochastic profiles of generation and consumption of electric energy. In the present study, it was possible to calculate the loading on the buses, finding all the magnitudes that involve the problem, making it possible to estimate and replace the conductors with loading above 66%. Resources used by OPENDSS to calculate IEEE123 and MATLAB network power flow for data management, network, noise filtering, network manipulation, among other resources. In addition, it was possible to calculate the cost of repowering the entire network after the simulation of the efficiency flow and the permutation of the points of generation and consumption.
